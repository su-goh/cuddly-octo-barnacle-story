This is Sunanda's story
Mr Fox can't fly but he wishes to, he was always angry about Mrs Fox because she could fly.
One day...

One day, Mr Fox met a beautiful flying ocyopus named Bob. Bob had beautiful 
orange skin that shone when he flew.  Mr Fox asked if Bib would help him
fly just like Mrs Fox, and Bob kindly agreed. He told him that he would give him the Power of the Barnacles to fly. 

Then, with the power of the Barnacles, Mr Fox was able to finally fly in the
sky along with Mrs Fox. However, the power of the Barnacles only worked while
Mr Fox had barnacles attached to his body, which really looked quite odd
next to Mrs. Fox.

This was not enough for Mr.Fox, he wanted to be able to independently fly! So he went home
and began designing a special fit fox aircraft sutited for him.
